# Task Management System - Full Stack Web Application

## Overview

This project is a full-stack web application for managing tasks, built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). The app allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks. It features a responsive UI, dynamic interactions, and state management, making use of various modern web technologies.

## Features

* **Responsive UI**: Built with HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap.
* **Dynamic Interactions**: JavaScript and jQuery are used for client-side functionality like form validation and DOM manipulation.
* **React Components**: Functional components, JSX, state, and props are used to build and render task lists.
* **State Management with Redux**: Task list state is managed with Redux, using actions, reducers, and a store.
* **Navigation with React Router**: The application includes navigation between different views (Dashboard, Add Task, Task Details).
* **Backend with Node.js & MongoDB**: A Node.js backend with Express.js handles API requests and interacts with a MongoDB database via Mongoose.
* **CRUD Operations**: Users can perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on tasks.

## Technology Stack

* **Frontend**:

  * React (for UI components)
  * Redux (for state management)
  * React Router (for navigation)
  * HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap (for responsive UI)
  * JavaScript (ES6 features) and jQuery (for DOM manipulation)

* **Backend**:

  * Node.js
  * Express.js
  * MongoDB (using Mongoose for data modeling)

* **Deployment**:

  * Deployment on **\[insert platform name here]** (Netlify/Heroku/Render/any other)

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

* **Node.js** (version 14 or higher)
* **MongoDB** (local or cloud database like MongoDB Atlas)

### Steps

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/task-management-system.git
   ```

2. Install frontend dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

3. Install backend dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd ../server
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up environment variables (e.g., MongoDB URI, JWT secret). Create a `.env` file in the `server` folder with the following content:

   ```plaintext
   MONGO_URI=your_mongo_database_uri
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
   ```

5. Run the backend:

   ```bash
   cd server
   npm start
   ```

6. Run the frontend:

   ```bash
   cd client
   npm start
   ```

The app should now be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## API Endpoints

Here are the available API endpoints for managing tasks:

### GET /api/tasks

Fetch all tasks.

### GET /api/tasks/\:id

Fetch a specific task by ID.

### POST /api/tasks

Create a new task. Required fields: `title`, `description`.

### PUT /api/tasks/\:id

Update a task. Fields can be updated: `title`, `description`, `status`.

### DELETE /api/tasks/\:id

Delete a task by ID.

## Folder Structure

```
/client
  /src
    /components      # React components
    /redux           # Redux store, actions, and reducers
    App.js           # Main React component
    index.js         # Entry point for React

/server
  /models           # Mongoose models
  /routes           # Express routes for tasks
  /controllers      # Controller logic for handling requests
  server.js         # Main backend entry point
  .env              # Environment variables
  package.json      # Backend dependencies
```

## Documentation

This README provides an overview of the project and how to get it running locally. For more details on how the app works, the technologies used, and the reasoning behind the architecture, please refer to the following sections:

### UI Design & Responsiveness

* The front-end is designed with HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap for a responsive and clean user interface.
* The layout adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring a smooth experience on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

### JavaScript/jQuery Integration

* JavaScript and jQuery are used for dynamic features like form validation and updating the task list without refreshing the page.
* The app uses ES6 features for better code structure and readability.

### React Implementation

* React components manage the UI and display tasks in a dynamic way, using props and state to handle changes.
* The task list is rendered dynamically, and task details can be viewed in individual components.

### Redux State Management

* Redux is used to manage the state of the task list.
* Actions, reducers, and the Redux store help manage tasks, ensuring consistent state management across the application.

### React Router Navigation

* React Router is used for navigating between different pages, such as the Dashboard, Add Task, and Task Details.
* This enables a seamless and SPA-like experience.

### Backend Integration

* The backend is built using Node.js and Express.js, which handle RESTful API requests for CRUD operations on tasks.
* MongoDB is used to store task data, and Mongoose is used to interact with the database.
